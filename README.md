About my username...
I usually wonder how you would pronounce some usernames on GitHub and elsewhere.
So, just in case *you* wonder how *my* username shall be pronounced:
it is [kabaʀnɛ] as it is a pun on the French wine grape Cabernet
which is pronounced [kabɛʀnɛ] in French and of course my surname.
